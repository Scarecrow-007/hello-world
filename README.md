# hello-world
just exploring GitHub and trying to understand it
I am literally just starting to learn here. I didn't feel like I was a complete noob when I started, but although I do have some conceptual knowledge about Computer Science, I am realizing more and more how I lack a great deal of software development knowledge. And I really need to start catching up!
